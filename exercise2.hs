{-
(Harder!) Check if a value is a prime number
OKâ€¦ start with a lambda expression to check if a number n is divisible by another, a:
(\ n a -> n `mod` a == 0)
Now generate all the factors of a number p (except 1 and p itself):
(\ p -> filter (\ a -> p `mod` a == 0) [2..p `div` 2])
The number is prime if that list is empty:
(\ x -> null (
 (\ p -> filter (\ a -> p `mod` a == 0) [2..p `div` 2]) x))
Still not quite right! We only want numbers > 1:
(\ x -> x > 1 && null (
 (\ p -> filter (\ a -> p `mod` a == 0) [2..p `div` 2]) x))
